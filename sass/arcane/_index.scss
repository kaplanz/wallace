/*
 * The `abstracts/` folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the
 * project. Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be put
 * in here.
 *
 * The rule of thumb for this folder is that it should not output a single line
 * of CSS when compiled on its own. These are nothing but Sass helpers.
 */
@import "abstracts";

/*
 * Most projects will have a `vendors/` folder containing all the CSS files from
 * external libraries and frameworks – Normalize, Bootstrap, jQueryUI,
 * FancyCarouselSliderjQueryPowered, and so on. Putting those aside in the same
 * folder is a good way to say “Hey, this is not from me, not my code, not my
 * responsibility”.
 */
@import "vendors";

/*
 * The `base/` folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the
 * project. In there, you might find the reset file, some typographic rules, and
 * probably a stylesheet defining some standard styles for commonly used HTML
 * elements (that I like to call `_base.scss`).
 */
@import "base";

/*
 * The `layout/` folder contains everything that takes part in laying out the site
 * or application. This folder could have stylesheets for the main parts of the
 * site (header, footer, navigation, sidebar...), the grid system or even CSS
 * styles for all the forms.
 */
@import "layout";

/*
 * For smaller components, there is the `components/` folder. While `layout/` is
 * macro (defining the global wireframe), `components/` is more focused on
 * widgets. It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a
 * widget, and basically anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of
 * files in `components/` since the whole site/application should be mostly
 * composed of tiny modules.
 */
@import "components";

/*
 * If you have page-specific styles, it is better to put them in a `pages/`
 * folder, in a file named after the page. For instance, it’s not uncommon to
 * have very specific styles for the home page hence the need for a `_home.scss`
 * file in `pages/`.
 */
@import "pages";

/*
 * On large sites and applications, it is not unusual to have different themes.
 * There are certainly different ways of dealing with themes but I personally
 * like having them all in a `themes/` folder.
